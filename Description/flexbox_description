# First we are gonna create the element at the top to represent our header
* So i create new <div> with class header and i put there the search bar
* The header is gonna have 3 sections: left, middle and right, so first i create 3 <div>
* Search bar will be in the middle section

# Next we are gonna take care of margin 
* I set margin in body to 0, so it will set all margins in all directions to 0

# Now i can start styling the header
* I add height to the header and i get into 55px in the header class
