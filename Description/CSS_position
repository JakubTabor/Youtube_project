# To create a header using these
* The header take space from 0px from the top and from 0px from left to 0px to right
* To correctly define the bottom, we instead use height to 50px and now it don't resize with the page

# We also add some spacing between the header and the content
* Sidebar is sticking to the bottom, so bottom will be 0, its sticking to the left, so left 0
* And from the top it will be 50px
* We don't want the sidebar to resize with the page, so i gonna use width instead of right
* And to make our element not covering the content i add padding, to add extra space on the left side

# Next i gonna use position absolute
* Position absolute take the same values as position fixed: left, right...
* The difference between fixed and absolute position is that
* For position fixed the elements are placed in the browser window
* For position absolute the elements are placed on the page 
* So when we scroll the browser window don't move, only the page is moving
* For position fixed the elements doesn't move when we scroll
* And for position absolute the elements move when we scroll, so we can put them on precise location on our page 

# We can use z-index to define which element appear in front and which behind
* And the higher z-index will appear in front of element with lower z-index

# We can place the element with position absolute inside the element with position fixed
