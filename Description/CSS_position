# To create a header using these
* The header take space from 0px from the top and from 0px from left to 0px to right
* To correctly define the bottom, we instead use height to 50px and now it don't resize with the page

# We also add some spacing between the header and the content
* Sidebar is sticking to the bottom, so bottom will be 0, its sticking to the left, so left 0
* And from the top it will be 50px
* We don't want the sidebar to resize with the page, so i gonna use width instead of right
* And to make our element not covering the content i add padding, to add extra space on the left side
